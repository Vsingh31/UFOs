# UFO sightings
## Overview of Project:
The purpose of this UFO sighting project is to build a dynamic webpage using JavaScript and HTML that accepts user inputs data and filters data accordingly to user choice and  display selected information about UFO sightings.In order to perform their analysis, users will be able to filter the UFO sightings table based on multiple criteria such as the event date, city, state, country and shape.For completing this purpose,I will modify the code of index.html(that i created in this module) file to create more table filters. I created the date filter in this module,and i will add more filters for the city, state, country, and shape to complete this challenge. Using JavaScript, I will replace the handleClick() function in my app.js file with a new function that saves the element, value, and id of the filter that was changed. Then, I will create a new function to loop through the dataset and keep only the results that match the search criteria. The webpage will be updated with the search criteria after pressing "Enter".


### Results:
* When I executed my Index.html file, my webpage of UFO sightings opened and there were searching text fields available there with prefilledvalue to show user what kind of data they have to put to get information, where user can put his query data to know about the UFO sightings information.First when i Opened my webpage it looks like:-

* **Initial page,before applying filters,look like this:-**

* When User apply one filter or more than one filters at the same time means user can search information by putting the specific information in one text box or more than one text   box to know information about UFO sightings.

* **After applying filters,with filtered result webpage looks like:-**

#### Summary:
* One **drawback** of this website design that instead of text box we should design **dropdown box** for every field so user can easily see and choose desire data for filtering. In this website text box given to filter data, where user put the value to know more information about UFO sightings. For knowing the value user have to know some information earlier before filtering.He have to dig and see all the table to know which value he will put to know desired information

* For further development,our drawback will become my recommendation that we will design our website with dropdown box so user will have information about that field infront of him/her.And with the help of dropdown box one more user problem will resolved that is now, no need to write value in text box(no mistake with upper and lower case ) in dropdown box user will only see and choose desired data.

* After filtering, I will recommend include a button to clear the filters and come to homepage of website is also needed. The button would be located below the last filter.
